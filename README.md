# GPPS - Characterisation and Segmentation of online (health) service users
## NHS England Analytical Insights

### About the Project

[![status: experimental](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/experimental.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#experimental)

This repository holds code for the project on the Characterisation and segmentation of online (health) servie users.
Research project using the GP Patient Survey (GPPS) 2021 row-level data to support NHSE evidence-based decision-making and strategy on Customer Experience and Digital Inclusion.

Questions to be answered:
- Who uses (GP) online services*? Which groups may be excluded?
- How do characteristics like a) sociodemographics ; b) clinical characteristics; c) local area internet speed, internet user profile and enablement; affect use* ?
Which are more prominent?
- Can we create clusters or pen portraits based on types of online health service users*?

_**Note:** Only public or fake data are shared in this repository._

### Project Stucture

- The main code is found in the root of the repository (see Usage below for more information)
- More information about the code usage can be found in the [model card](./model_card.md)
- {OTHER REPO STRUCTURE}

### Built With

R

- {LIST OF MAIN PACKAGE VERSIONS}

### Getting Started

#### Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

To clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/nhsx/{REPO NAME}`

To create a suitable environment:
- Open or create an R project in the root folder.

### Usage
- Repo in construction. Codebase to be added.

#### Outputs
- Stakeholder deck with insights and avenues for further use of techniques in research.
- HACA 2023 conference presentation, available [here](https://youtu.be/mt8LpvVPfUc?si=7mvbf8kBxyhtj_4e) .

{NOTES ON REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESULTS}

#### Datasets
- GP Patient Survey 2021, selected questions. More information on the survey is available [here](https://www.gp-patient.co.uk/surveysandreports2021). Aggregate information is available online but this work required access to the respondent-level information through an internal data access request.
- CDRC Internet User Classification. Dataset available [here](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/internet-user-classification).

- We aim to in due course share a dummy data version against which the code could be run (though insights themselves will not be obtained given the expected random and non-multivariately correlated nature of this dummy dataset).
